    "While on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), I came across a patient appointment data set ([here]( (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)). It has over 300,000 patients as well as information about the appointment date and several binary health indicators about each patient. It posed a question, \"Why do 30% of patients miss their appointments?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And that was it. There was no additional context about where this data came from or if the health indicators were from the doctor's records or self reported. There was no description about even what country this data was from. Furthermore, there were clear typos in the column headings such as \"Alcoolism\" and \"HiperTension\" but nonetheless,I got curious about this dataset of over 300,000 people - why do **30%** of patients **miss** their appointments? \n",
    "\n",
    "I intended to find out. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all, missed doctor appointments are a huge deal in the US. It is estimated by Healthcare industry professionals that missed appointments cost the US over \\$150 billion  per year or between \\$100 and \\$1000 per patient depending on location and specialty of the practice ([source 1](http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/insight-tackling-healthcares-costly-problem-missed-appointments), [source 2](https://www.everseat.com/blog/missed-appointments-affect-more-than-just-revenue/)). These estimates are in revenue and are not including the extra cost of staff trying to track down these patients for future appointments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital systems recognize this huge attrition problem and are trying to get to the bottom of why patients are missing appointments. When asked, patients say that they simply forget that they had an appointment ([source 3](http://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2296-6-47)). Therefore, hospital systems are trying to address this forgetfulness problem using various automated reminder systems, including text message reminders, similar to the SMS reminders in our dataset. But do these reminders have an impact? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I first wanted to know more about the dataset - Who are these patients? What are their median ages? Is their overall health representative of the United States or perhaps of a different country all together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I wanted to know more about these missed appointments - was there a certain day that had more missed appointments? Did age matter? What, if any, trends could I find relating to these missed appointments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, what was the impact of these text message reminders? Unfortunately, we do not have any context regarding these text messages, such as what the text messages said or when they were sent in relation to a patient's appointment date. That being said, did simply receiving a text message affect the rate of showing up to an appointment?\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who are the patients in this data set?\n",
    "2. What factors contributed to missing an appointment?\n",
    "3. Did receiving a text message affect a patient's ability to show up?\n"
